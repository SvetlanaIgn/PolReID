We offer our own dataset, called PolReID, for the formation of which video sequences received from volunteers were used. For each person, there are from 1 to 7 video sequences with different locations, illumination levels, image quality and distance from the CCTV camera. Thus, images for most people also correspond to different domains. To extract bounding boxes from frames, the YOLOv4 detection algorithm implemented in pyTorch was used. Incorrect bounding boxes were removed manually. For each person in the dataset, there are images with partial overlap, both horizontal and vertical. The same person is presented from different angles. In total, the dataset contains images for 54 people and includes 5,609 bounding boxes. PolReID is split into training and testing data. For training, 30 people (3603 bounding boxes) are used, for testing - 24 people (2006 bounding boxes).
